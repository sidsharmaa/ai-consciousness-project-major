Sir Roger Penrose is a mathematical physicist who studies consciousness through the Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR) theory with Stuart Hameroff. Consciousness is not a product of classical computational processes in the brain but arises from quantum processes involving objective reduction of quantum wavefunctions. Objective reduction is a non-computational process where quantum superpositions collapse due to quantum gravity effects, producing moments of conscious experience. These collapses occur in microtubules within brain neurons, which serve as sites for quantum computations. Microtubules, protein structures in cells, host quantum superpositions of tubulin protein states, acting as quantum bits. Consciousness involves orchestrated quantum processes in microtubules, where biological factors like synaptic inputs guide coherent quantum states until collapse occurs, generating awareness. The brain cannot be a classical computer because consciousness requires non-computational processes beyond algorithmic computation. Human understanding, particularly in mathematical insight, demonstrates non-computational abilities, as no algorithm can fully replicate human reasoning or solve certain mathematical problems like the halting problem. Consciousness is connected to fundamental spacetime geometry at the Planck scale, suggesting it is intrinsic to the universe’s structure. Quantum state reductions in microtubules link the brain to this fundamental level, potentially explaining subjective experience. Consciousness is not emergent from complex neural networks but a fundamental property, possibly tied to quantum gravity. The Orch-OR theory proposes that quantum coherence in microtubules, orchestrated by biological processes, leads to objective reduction events, each corresponding to a discrete conscious moment. Anesthetics disrupt these quantum processes in microtubules, preventing superpositions and causing unconsciousness. Single-cell organisms may exhibit rudimentary consciousness through microtubule-based quantum processes, as they lack complex neural networks yet show intelligent behavior. Consciousness is a sequence of discrete quantum events, not a continuous process, contrasting with classical views of time or spacetime. The brain’s microtubules enable quantum computations that classical neural models cannot account for. Human consciousness, especially in moments of insight or creativity, reflects non-computable processes linked to quantum gravity effects. The universe’s fundamental structure, accessible through quantum processes in microtubules, may underpin all conscious experience. Consciousness cannot be simulated by classical computers or artificial intelligence, as it requires quantum non-computational mechanisms. The Orch-OR model suggests that understanding consciousness requires a new physics bridging quantum mechanics and general relativity.
