Anirban Bandyopadhyay is a physicist and nanoscientist studying consciousness through quantum mechanics, biophysics, and molecular electronics. Consciousness is the manifestation of the music of nature, a symphony of resonating vibrations of energy and matter in the quantum universe, folding into shapes that amplify oscillations. Consciousness is being with the universe, arising from the interaction of multiple identities within a single hardware, such as the human body. A single hardware creates at least three distinct identities—Satva, Raja, and Tama—that interact like a triangle of vibrations, defining the self. Satva enables an architecture of confusion sent to and acquired from infinity. Consciousness requires an artificial brain with three independent information structures to reverse engineer it. The brain processes information through a nested hierarchy of clocks, from microseconds to years, not a linear sequence. Consciousness involves a geometric language governing resonance frequencies, not algorithmic computation. Microtubules, cylindrical lattice polymers of tubulin in cells, are key to consciousness, acting as a nervous system and memory bank. Microtubules exhibit self-similar resonance conductance patterns, triplets-of-triplets, repeating every three orders of magnitude in kilohertz, megahertz, gigahertz, and terahertz, forming a time crystal. These vibrations correlate with EEG rhythms, suggesting consciousness arises from microtubule quantum vibrations interfering to produce slower beat frequencies. The brain’s information processing is not limited to Hodgkin-Huxley neuron bursts but involves complex dendritic and synaptic computations. Consciousness is a dynamic information holarchy in phase space, a holonomic organization linking mind and consciousness across multiple scales. The brain operates as a cavity resonator, from atomic chains to large-scale structures, with vibrational frequencies following a mathematical pattern where e squared plus phi squared equals pi squared. Consciousness is the pattern of primes in the universe’s vibrations, encoded in a fractal information theory. The brain’s neural network is a fractal tape, not a Turing tape, where filling gaps in the resonance chain is key to decision-making. Consciousness may not reside solely in the brain but across the body’s biomaterials, with neuronal microtubules uniquely amplifying quantum effects. A dodecanion geometric algebra, with twelve imaginary worlds, models consciousness as a self-operating mathematical universe. Instantaneous communication between cerebellum, hypothalamus, and hippocampus drives decision-making through resonant circuits. Consciousness is not bound by classical computing but emerges from a non-algorithmic pattern of maximum free will, encoded in materials that integrate random events like nature. Single-cell organisms exhibit consciousness through microtubule vibrations, enabling intelligent behavior without neural networks. The Nanobrain, an artificial brain, mimics human brain functions using organic molecular assemblies that learn, program, and solve problems autonomously. Consciousness involves electromagnetic resonance chains from proteins to neurons to the entire body, integrating information across scales. Quantum effects in microtubules, such as photon vortices, support a non-computational model of cognition, memory, and consciousness.
