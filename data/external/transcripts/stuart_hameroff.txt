Stuart Hameroff is an anesthesiologist and professor studying consciousness through the Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR) theory with Roger Penrose. Consciousness arises from quantum computations in microtubules within brain neurons. Microtubules are protein structures in cells acting as quantum channels. Quantum superpositions in microtubules collapse through objective reduction, influenced by quantum gravity, creating discrete moments of conscious awareness or choice. Consciousness is not merely an emergent property of complex neural computation but involves non-computational quantum processes. Microtubules, composed of tubulin proteins, contain aromatic amino acids with pi electron resonance clouds forming quantum bits for quantum computation. Quantum coherence and entanglement in microtubules enable collective behavior, where individual tubulin states act as a single quantum system. Anesthetics disrupt these quantum processes by binding to non-polar regions of tubulin, preventing quantum oscillations and causing unconsciousness. Quantum vibrations in microtubules occur in terahertz, gigahertz, megahertz, kilohertz, and hertz frequency ranges, suggesting a scale-invariant hierarchy in brain processes. Consciousness may be fundamental to the universe, not just a brain emergent phenomenon, and could precede life, supported by quantum biology in photosynthesis and bird navigation. Microtubules connect the brain to fundamental spacetime geometry at the Planck scale, potentially explaining spiritual phenomena like interconnectedness, afterlife, and reincarnation. Consciousness is a hologram generated by interference among quantum oscillations in spacetime geometry from laser-like coherence in microtubules in cortical pyramidal neurons. Single-cell organisms like paramecia exhibit intelligent behaviors, such as swimming, finding food, and avoiding obstacles, using microtubules without synapses, suggesting basic consciousness. All cells with microtubules may have memory and infrequent consciousness due to quantum coherence and entanglement essential for life. Anesthetics selectively erase consciousness while leaving other brain functions intact by disrupting quantum wavefunction collapse in microtubules. The Orch-OR theory challenges the view of the brain as a classical computer, proposing that consciousness involves non-computational processes beyond neural firing and synaptic activity. The conscious pilot theory describes consciousness as spatiotemporal envelopes of dendritic synchrony moving through the brain as a conscious agent, akin to executive awareness in AI. Deep meditative states and psychedelics elevate consciousness to higher frequencies, including quantum nonlocality, construed as pure consciousness. Consciousness is a sequence of discrete quantum state reductions, contrasting with continuous time or spacetime geometry views. Microtubules enable self-organizing molecular computation sufficient for consciousness. The brainâ€™s complexity alone cannot account for consciousness, which requires both quantum and classical processes in microtubules. Near-death experiences and reincarnation may be supported by quantum processes in microtubules through entanglement and persistence of quantum information. Consciousness cannot be fully defined or measured, but studying what is lost under anesthesia reveals its quantum nature in microtubules.
