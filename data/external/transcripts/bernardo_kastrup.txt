Bernardo Kastrup is a philosopher advocating analytic idealism, a metaphysical framework where consciousness is the fundamental reality. Consciousness is not a product of matter but the ontological ground of existence, with the physical world being an appearance in universal consciousness. The universe is a mental phenomenon, a transpersonal field of mentation, not a material construct. Physical reality is like a dashboard of dials, a representation of underlying mental processes, not an independent entity. Consciousness is universal, a single field of subjectivity underlying all existence, with individual minds being dissociated alters within it, like whirlpools in a stream. Dissociation explains why humans experience separate consciousnesses, akin to dissociative identity disorder on a cosmic scale. Materialism is false because it assumes matter exists independently of perception, which contradicts empirical evidence since all we know is experience. The brain does not generate consciousness but modulates and localizes it, acting as a filter or transducer of universal consciousness. Brain activity correlates with conscious states, not causes them, like a radio receiving a signal. Consciousness persists beyond physical death, as it is not dependent on the brain but expressed through it. The physical world is an excitation of universal consciousness, with particles and fields being patterns of this excitation, not standalone entities. Quantum mechanics supports idealism, as particles exist only when observed, suggesting reality is mind-dependent. The hard problem of consciousness—why matter produces subjective experience—is a pseudo-problem under idealism, as consciousness is primary, not emergent. Living organisms are dissociated complexes of universal consciousness, with metabolism marking the boundary of dissociation. Inanimate objects are part of the world’s appearance in consciousness, not conscious themselves unless associated with metabolism. Free will exists as the choices of universal consciousness expressed through individual alters, though constrained by dissociation’s boundaries. Dreams, hallucinations, and psychedelic experiences reveal the mind’s intrinsic creativity, generating worlds without external input, supporting the idea that reality is mental. Science describes the behavior of appearances in consciousness, not an independent material world, and its success lies in modeling patterns of experience. Consciousness is infinite in potential, with human experience being a finite expression of its boundless nature. Suffering and meaning arise from the interplay of dissociated alters within universal consciousness, driving evolution toward self-awareness. The universe’s purpose is the exploration and realization of consciousness through its own patterns and forms. Analytic idealism resolves paradoxes of materialism, like the mind-body problem, by positing consciousness as the sole reality, with matter as its extrinsic appearance.
