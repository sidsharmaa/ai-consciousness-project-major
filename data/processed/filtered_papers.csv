Creating benchmarkable components to measure the quality ofAI-enhanced developer tools,"Elise Paradis, Ambar Murillo, Maulishree Pandey, Sarah D'Angelo, Matthew Hughes, Andrew Macvean, Ben Ferrari-Church","In the AI community, benchmarks to evaluate model quality are well
established, but an equivalent approach to benchmarking products built upon
generative AI models is still missing. This has had two consequences. First, it
has made teams focus on model quality over the developer experience, while
successful products combine both. Second, product team have struggled to answer
questions about their products in relation to their competitors.
  In this case study, we share: (1) our process to create robust,
enterprise-grade and modular components to support the benchmarking of the
developer experience (DX) dimensions of our team's AI for code offerings, and
(2) the components we have created to do so, including demographics and
attitudes towards AI surveys, a benchmarkable task, and task and feature
surveys. By doing so, we hope to lower the barrier to the DX benchmarking of
genAI-enhanced code products.",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12211v1,cs.SE,"creating benchmarkable components to measure the quality ofai-enhanced developer tools in the ai community, benchmarks to evaluate model quality are well

Nonequilibrium physics of brain dynamics,"Ram√≥n Nartallo-Kaluarachchi, Morten L. Kringelbach, Gustavo Deco, Renaud Lambiotte, Alain Goriely","Information processing in the brain is coordinated by the dynamic activity of
neurons and neural populations at a range of spatiotemporal scales. These
dynamics, captured in the form of electrophysiological recordings and
neuroimaging, show evidence of time-irreversibility and broken detailed balance
suggesting that the brain operates in a nonequilibrium stationary state.
Furthermore, the level of nonequilibrium, measured by entropy production or
irreversibility appears to be a crucial signature of cognitive complexity and
consciousness. The subsequent study of neural dynamics from the perspective of
nonequilibrium statistical physics is an emergent field that challenges the
assumptions of symmetry and maximum-entropy that are common in traditional
models. In this review, we discuss the plethora of exciting results emerging at
the interface of nonequilibrium dynamics and neuroscience. We begin with an
introduction to the mathematical paradigms necessary to understand
nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous and discrete state-spaces. Next, we
review both model-free and model-based approaches to analysing nonequilibrium
dynamics in both continuous-state recordings and neural spike-trains, as well
as the results of such analyses. We briefly consider the topic of
nonequilibrium computation in neural systems, before concluding with a
discussion and outlook on the field.",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12188v1,q-bio.NC,"nonequilibrium physics of brain dynamics information processing in the brain is coordinated by the dynamic activity of

Perceptions of Agentic AI in Organizations: Implications for Responsible AI and ROI,Lee Ackerman,"As artificial intelligence (AI) systems rapidly gain autonomy, the need for
robust responsible AI frameworks becomes paramount. This paper investigates how
organizations perceive and adapt such frameworks amidst the emerging landscape
of increasingly sophisticated agentic AI. Employing an interpretive qualitative
approach, the study explores the lived experiences of AI professionals.
Findings highlight that the inherent complexity of agentic AI systems and their
responsible implementation, rooted in the intricate interconnectedness of
responsible AI dimensions and the thematic framework (an analytical structure
developed from the data), combined with the novelty of agentic AI, contribute
to significant challenges in organizational adaptation, characterized by
knowledge gaps, a limited emphasis on stakeholder engagement, and a strong
focus on control. These factors, by hindering effective adaptation and
implementation, ultimately compromise the potential for responsible AI and the
realization of ROI.",2025-04-15,2025-04-15,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11564v1,cs.CY,"perceptions of agentic ai in organizations: implications for responsible ai and roi as artificial intelligence (ai) systems rapidly gain autonomy, the need for

Embodied World Models Emerge from Navigational Task in Open-Ended Environments,"Li Jin, Liu Jia","Understanding how artificial systems can develop spatial awareness and
reasoning has long been a challenge in AI research. Traditional models often
rely on passive observation, but embodied cognition theory suggests that deeper
understanding emerges from active interaction with the environment. This study
investigates whether neural networks can autonomously internalize spatial
concepts through interaction, focusing on planar navigation tasks. Using Gated
Recurrent Units (GRUs) combined with Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL), we
show that agents can learn to encode spatial properties like direction,
distance, and obstacle avoidance. We introduce Hybrid Dynamical Systems (HDS)
to model the agent-environment interaction as a closed dynamical system,
revealing stable limit cycles that correspond to optimal navigation strategies.
Ridge Representation allows us to map navigation paths into a fixed-dimensional
behavioral space, enabling comparison with neural states. Canonical Correlation
Analysis (CCA) confirms strong alignment between these representations,
suggesting that the agent's neural states actively encode spatial knowledge.
Intervention experiments further show that specific neural dimensions are
causally linked to navigation performance. This work provides an approach to
bridging the gap between action and perception in AI, offering new insights
into building adaptive, interpretable models that can generalize across complex
environments. The causal validation of neural representations also opens new
avenues for understanding and controlling the internal mechanisms of AI
systems, pushing the boundaries of how machines learn and reason in dynamic,
real-world scenarios.",2025-04-15,2025-04-15,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11419v1,cs.AI,"embodied world models emerge from navigational task in open-ended environments understanding how artificial systems can develop spatial awareness and

VideoPanda: Video Panoramic Diffusion with Multi-view Attention,"Kevin Xie, Amirmojtaba Sabour, Jiahui Huang, Despoina Paschalidou, Greg Klar, Umar Iqbal, Sanja Fidler, Xiaohui Zeng","High resolution panoramic video content is paramount for immersive
experiences in Virtual Reality, but is non-trivial to collect as it requires
specialized equipment and intricate camera setups. In this work, we introduce
VideoPanda, a novel approach for synthesizing 360$^\circ$ videos conditioned on
text or single-view video data. VideoPanda leverages multi-view attention
layers to augment a video diffusion model, enabling it to generate consistent
multi-view videos that can be combined into immersive panoramic content.
VideoPanda is trained jointly using two conditions: text-only and single-view
video, and supports autoregressive generation of long-videos. To overcome the
computational burden of multi-view video generation, we randomly subsample the
duration and camera views used during training and show that the model is able
to gracefully generalize to generating more frames during inference. Extensive
evaluations on both real-world and synthetic video datasets demonstrate that
VideoPanda generates more realistic and coherent 360$^\circ$ panoramas across
all input conditions compared to existing methods. Visit the project website at
https://research-staging.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/VideoPanda/ for results.",2025-04-15,2025-04-15,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11389v1,cs.GR,"videopanda: video panoramic diffusion with multi-view attention high resolution panoramic video content is paramount for immersive

"Smartphone-Based Undergraduate Physics Labs: A Comprehensive Review of Innovation, Accessibility, and Pedagogical Impact",Yiping Zhao,"Smartphone-integrated physics laboratories (SmartIPLs) have emerged as
scalable and cost-effective alternatives to traditional lab instruction,
providing accessible, hands-on experiences for diverse learning environments.
This review synthesizes over a decade of research, covering nearly 200
SmartIPLs across key physics domains such as mechanics, optics, acoustics,
electromagnetism, thermodynamics, and modern physics. SmartIPLs are categorized
into two primary types: sensor-based experiments using built-in smartphone
tools and camera-based video/image analysis for motion and optical studies.
Empirical studies show that SmartIPLs support equal or greater gains in
conceptual understanding, science process skills, and student engagement,
especially in remote and under-resourced settings. The review explores their
theoretical foundations, compares them to traditional and virtual labs, and
addresses challenges such as device variability and classroom integration.
Future directions include broader curricular integration, AI-driven student
feedback, expansion into underrepresented physics topics, interdisciplinary
applications, and equity-focused instructional design. Open-access resources,
such as the UGA SmartPhone Intro Physics Lab and Modern Optics YouTube channels
and the SPIE book Use of Smartphones in Optical Experimentation, highlight
community-driven efforts to expand and democratize physics education. As
smartphone technology advances, SmartIPLs will offer a promising path toward
