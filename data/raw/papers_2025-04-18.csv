FLIP Reasoning Challenge,"Andreas Plesner, Turlan Kuzhagaliyev, Roger Wattenhofer","Over the past years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have
demonstrated how AI can solve many perception and generation tasks, such as
image classification and text writing, yet reasoning remains a challenge. This
paper introduces the FLIP dataset, a benchmark for evaluating AI reasoning
capabilities based on human verification tasks on the Idena blockchain. FLIP
challenges present users with two orderings of 4 images, requiring them to
identify the logically coherent one. By emphasizing sequential reasoning,
visual storytelling, and common sense, FLIP provides a unique testbed for
multimodal AI systems. Our experiments evaluate state-of-the-art models,
leveraging both vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs).
Results reveal that even the best open-sourced and closed-sourced models
achieve maximum accuracies of 75.5% and 77.9%, respectively, in zero-shot
settings, compared to human performance of 95.3%. Captioning models aid
reasoning models by providing text descriptions of images, yielding better
results than when using the raw images directly, 69.6% vs. 75.2% for Gemini 1.5
Pro. Combining the predictions from 15 models in an ensemble increases the
accuracy to 85.2%. These findings highlight the limitations of existing
reasoning models and the need for robust multimodal benchmarks like FLIP. The
full codebase and dataset will be available at

Comparative Evaluation of Radiomics and Deep Learning Models for Disease Detection in Chest Radiography,"Zhijin He, Alan B. McMillan","The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has
revolutionized diagnostic practices, enabling advanced analysis and
interpretation of radiological data. This study presents a comprehensive
evaluation of radiomics-based and deep learning-based approaches for disease
detection in chest radiography, focusing on COVID-19, lung opacity, and viral
pneumonia. While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), learn directly from image data,
radiomics-based models extract and analyze quantitative features, potentially
providing advantages in data-limited scenarios. This study systematically
compares the diagnostic accuracy and robustness of various AI models, including
Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for radiomics, against
state-of-the-art computer vision deep learning architectures. Performance
metrics across varying sample sizes reveal insights into each model's efficacy,
highlighting the contexts in which specific AI approaches may offer enhanced
diagnostic capabilities. The results aim to inform the integration of AI-driven
diagnostic tools in clinical practice, particularly in automated and
high-throughput environments where timely, reliable diagnosis is critical. This
comparative study addresses an essential gap, establishing guidance for the
selection of AI models based on clinical and operational needs.",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12249v1,eess.IV
Creating benchmarkable components to measure the quality ofAI-enhanced developer tools,"Elise Paradis, Ambar Murillo, Maulishree Pandey, Sarah D'Angelo, Matthew Hughes, Andrew Macvean, Ben Ferrari-Church","In the AI community, benchmarks to evaluate model quality are well
established, but an equivalent approach to benchmarking products built upon
generative AI models is still missing. This has had two consequences. First, it
has made teams focus on model quality over the developer experience, while
successful products combine both. Second, product team have struggled to answer
questions about their products in relation to their competitors.
  In this case study, we share: (1) our process to create robust,
enterprise-grade and modular components to support the benchmarking of the
developer experience (DX) dimensions of our team's AI for code offerings, and
(2) the components we have created to do so, including demographics and
attitudes towards AI surveys, a benchmarkable task, and task and feature
surveys. By doing so, we hope to lower the barrier to the DX benchmarking of
genAI-enhanced code products.",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12211v1,cs.SE
Communication Optimization for Decentralized Learning atop Bandwidth-limited Edge Networks,"Tingyang Sun, Tuan Nguyen, Ting He","Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is a promising machine learning
paradigm for bringing artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to the network
edge. Running DFL on top of edge networks, however, faces severe performance
challenges due to the extensive parameter exchanges between agents. Most
existing solutions for these challenges were based on simplistic communication
models, which cannot capture the case of learning over a multi-hop
bandwidth-limited network. In this work, we address this problem by jointly
designing the communication scheme for the overlay network formed by the agents
and the mixing matrix that controls the communication demands between the
agents. By carefully analyzing the properties of our problem, we cast each
design problem into a tractable optimization and develop an efficient algorithm
with guaranteed performance. Our evaluations based on real topology and data
show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the total training time by over
$80\%$ compared to the baseline without sacrificing accuracy, while
significantly improving the computational efficiency over the state of the art.",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12210v1,cs.NI
Beyond Patches: Mining Interpretable Part-Prototypes for Explainable AI,"Mahdi Alehdaghi, Rajarshi Bhattacharya, Pourya Shamsolmoali, Rafael M. O. Cruz, Maguelonne Heritier, Eric Granger","Deep learning has provided considerable advancements for multimedia systems,
yet the interpretability of deep models remains a challenge. State-of-the-art
post-hoc explainability methods, such as GradCAM, provide visual interpretation
based on heatmaps but lack conceptual clarity. Prototype-based approaches, like
ProtoPNet and PIPNet, offer a more structured explanation but rely on fixed
patches, limiting their robustness and semantic consistency.
  To address these limitations, a part-prototypical concept mining network
(PCMNet) is proposed that dynamically learns interpretable prototypes from
meaningful regions. PCMNet clusters prototypes into concept groups, creating
semantically grounded explanations without requiring additional annotations.
Through a joint process of unsupervised part discovery and concept activation
vector extraction, PCMNet effectively captures discriminative concepts and
makes interpretable classification decisions.
  Our extensive experiments comparing PCMNet against state-of-the-art methods
on multiple datasets show that it can provide a high level of interpretability,
stability, and robustness under clean and occluded scenarios.",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12197v1,cs.CV
Nonequilibrium physics of brain dynamics,"Ram√≥n Nartallo-Kaluarachchi, Morten L. Kringelbach, Gustavo Deco, Renaud Lambiotte, Alain Goriely","Information processing in the brain is coordinated by the dynamic activity of
neurons and neural populations at a range of spatiotemporal scales. These
dynamics, captured in the form of electrophysiological recordings and
neuroimaging, show evidence of time-irreversibility and broken detailed balance
suggesting that the brain operates in a nonequilibrium stationary state.
Furthermore, the level of nonequilibrium, measured by entropy production or
irreversibility appears to be a crucial signature of cognitive complexity and
consciousness. The subsequent study of neural dynamics from the perspective of
nonequilibrium statistical physics is an emergent field that challenges the
assumptions of symmetry and maximum-entropy that are common in traditional
models. In this review, we discuss the plethora of exciting results emerging at
the interface of nonequilibrium dynamics and neuroscience. We begin with an
introduction to the mathematical paradigms necessary to understand
nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous and discrete state-spaces. Next, we
review both model-free and model-based approaches to analysing nonequilibrium
dynamics in both continuous-state recordings and neural spike-trains, as well
as the results of such analyses. We briefly consider the topic of
nonequilibrium computation in neural systems, before concluding with a
discussion and outlook on the field.",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12188v1,q-bio.NC
AI Behind Closed Doors: a Primer on The Governance of Internal Deployment,"Charlotte Stix, Matteo Pistillo, Girish Sastry, Marius Hobbhahn, Alejandro Ortega, Mikita Balesni, Annika Hallensleben, Nix Goldowsky-Dill, Lee Sharkey","The most advanced future AI systems will first be deployed inside the
frontier AI companies developing them. According to these companies and
independent experts, AI systems may reach or even surpass human intelligence
and capabilities by 2030. Internal deployment is, therefore, a key source of
benefits and risks from frontier AI systems. Despite this, the governance of
the internal deployment of highly advanced frontier AI systems appears absent.
This report aims to address this absence by priming a conversation around the
governance of internal deployment. It presents a conceptualization of internal
deployment, learnings from other sectors, reviews of existing legal frameworks
and their applicability, and illustrative examples of the type of scenarios we
are most concerned about. Specifically, it discusses the risks correlated to
the loss of control via the internal application of a misaligned AI system to
the AI research and development pipeline, and unconstrained and undetected
power concentration behind closed doors. The report culminates with a small
number of targeted recommendations that provide a first blueprint for the

ARCeR: an Agentic RAG for the Automated Definition of Cyber Ranges,"Matteo Lupinacci, Francesco Blefari, Francesco Romeo, Francesco Aurelio Pironti, Angelo Furfaro","The growing and evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats necessitates the
development of supporting tools and platforms that allow for the creation of
realistic IT environments operating within virtual, controlled settings as
Cyber Ranges (CRs). CRs can be exploited for analyzing vulnerabilities and
experimenting with the effectiveness of devised countermeasures, as well as
serving as training environments for building cyber security skills and
abilities for IT operators. This paper proposes ARCeR as an innovative solution
for the automatic generation and deployment of CRs, starting from user-provided
descriptions in a natural language. ARCeR relies on the Agentic RAG paradigm,
which allows it to fully exploit state-of-art AI technologies. Experimental
results show that ARCeR is able to successfully process prompts even in cases
that LLMs or basic RAG systems are not able to cope with. Furthermore, ARCeR is
able to target any CR framework provided that specific knowledge is made
available to it.",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12143v1,cs.CR
Towards LLM Agents for Earth Observation,"Chia Hsiang Kao, Wenting Zhao, Shreelekha Revankar, Samuel Speas, Snehal Bhagat, Rajeev Datta, Cheng Perng Phoo, Utkarsh Mall, Carl Vondrick, Kavita Bala, Bharath Hariharan","Earth Observation (EO) provides critical planetary data for environmental

Here we ask: Are AI systems ready for reliable Earth Observation? We introduce
\datasetnamenospace, a benchmark of 140 yes/no questions from NASA Earth
Observatory articles across 13 topics and 17 satellite sensors. Using Google
Earth Engine API as a tool, LLM agents can only achieve an accuracy of 33%
because the code fails to run over 58% of the time. We improve the failure rate
for open models by fine-tuning synthetic data, allowing much smaller models
(Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve comparable accuracy to much larger ones (e.g.,
DeepSeek-R1). Taken together, our findings identify significant challenges to
be solved before AI agents can automate earth observation, and suggest paths

"Reasoning-Based AI for Startup Evaluation (R.A.I.S.E.): A Memory-Augmented, Multi-Step Decision Framework","Jack Preuveneers, Joseph Ternasky, Fuat Alican, Yigit Ihlamur","We present a novel framework that bridges the gap between the
interpretability of decision trees and the advanced reasoning capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) to predict startup success. Our approach leverages
chain-of-thought prompting to generate detailed reasoning logs, which are
subsequently distilled into structured, human-understandable logical rules. The
pipeline integrates multiple enhancements - efficient data ingestion, a
two-step refinement process, ensemble candidate sampling, simulated
reinforcement learning scoring, and persistent memory - to ensure both stable
decision-making and transparent output. Experimental evaluations on curated
startup datasets demonstrate that our combined pipeline improves precision by
54% from 0.225 to 0.346 and accuracy by 50% from 0.46 to 0.70 compared to a
standalone OpenAI o3 model. Notably, our model achieves over 2x the precision
of a random classifier (16%). By combining state-of-the-art AI reasoning with
explicit rule-based explanations, our method not only augments traditional
decision-making processes but also facilitates expert intervention and
continuous policy refinement. This work lays the foundation for the
implementation of interpretable LLM-powered decision frameworks in high-stakes
investment environments and other domains that require transparent and
data-driven insights.",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12090v1,cs.AI
Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning for Interpretable Decision-Making in Supply Chain Management,"Stefano Genetti, Alberto Longobardi, Giovanni Iacca","In the context of Industry 4.0, Supply Chain Management (SCM) faces
challenges in adopting advanced optimization techniques due to the ""black-box""
nature of most AI-based solutions, which causes reluctance among company
stakeholders. To overcome this issue, in this work, we employ an Interpretable
Artificial Intelligence (IAI) approach that combines evolutionary computation
with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to generate interpretable decision-making
policies in the form of decision trees. This IAI solution is embedded within a
simulation-based optimization framework specifically designed to handle the
inherent uncertainties and stochastic behaviors of modern supply chains. To our
knowledge, this marks the first attempt to combine IAI with simulation-based
optimization for decision-making in SCM. The methodology is tested on two
supply chain optimization problems, one fictional and one from the real world,
and its performance is compared against widely used optimization and RL
algorithms. The results reveal that the interpretable approach delivers
competitive, and sometimes better, performance, challenging the prevailing
notion that there must be a trade-off between interpretability and optimization
efficiency. Additionally, the developed framework demonstrates strong potential
for industrial applications, offering seamless integration with various
Python-based algorithms.",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12023v1,cs.NE
Active Human Feedback Collection via Neural Contextual Dueling Bandits,"Arun Verma, Xiaoqiang Lin, Zhongxiang Dai, Daniela Rus, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low","Collecting human preference feedback is often expensive, leading recent works
to develop principled algorithms to select them more efficiently. However,
these works assume that the underlying reward function is linear, an assumption
that does not hold in many real-life applications, such as online
recommendation and LLM alignment. To address this limitation, we propose
Neural-ADB, an algorithm based on the neural contextual dueling bandit
framework that provides a principled and practical method for collecting human
preference feedback when the underlying latent reward function is non-linear.
We theoretically show that when preference feedback follows the
Bradley-Terry-Luce model, the worst sub-optimality gap of the policy learned by
Neural-ADB decreases at a sub-linear rate as the preference dataset increases.
Our experimental results on problem instances derived from synthetic preference
datasets further validate the effectiveness of Neural-ADB.",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12016v1,cs.LG
Purposefully Induced Psychosis (PIP): Embracing Hallucination as Imagination in Large Language Models,"Kris Pilcher, Esen K. T√ºt√ºnc√º","Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely regarded as errors
- outputs that deviate from factual accuracy. However, in creative or
exploratory contexts, these ""mistakes"" may represent unexpected avenues for
innovation. We introduce Purposefully Induced Psychosis (PIP), a novel approach
that amplifies LLM hallucinations for imaginative tasks such as speculative
fiction, interactive storytelling, and mixed-reality simulations. Drawing on
Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, where Pip's ""madness"" reveals profound insight, we
reframe hallucinations as a source of computational imagination rather than a
flaw. Our method fine-tunes LLMs to encourage speculative, metaphorical, and
surreal outputs - hallucinations that are useful when factual accuracy is not
the chief objective. Inspired by the consensual illusions of theater and stage
magic, PIP situates these creative missteps in contexts where users willingly
suspend disbelief, thereby transforming ""errors"" into catalysts for new ways of
thinking. We discuss potential applications, design principles for ensuring
user consent, preliminary observations, and implications for broader AI ethics

The Evolution of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) from Concept to Implementation,"Md Nasiruzzaman, Maaruf Ali, Iftekhar Salam, Mahdi H. Miraz","Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is one of the paradigm changes in
cybersecurity, from the traditional perimeter-based model to perimeterless.
This article studies the core concepts of ZTA, its beginning, a few use cases
and future trends. Emphasising the always verify and least privilege access,
some key tenets of ZTA have grown to be integration technologies like Identity
Management, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and real-time analytics. ZTA is
expected to strengthen cloud environments, education, work environments
(including from home) while controlling other risks like lateral movement and
insider threats. Despite ZTA's benefits, it comes with challenges in the form
of complexity, performance overhead and vulnerabilities in the control plane.
These require phased implementation and continuous refinement to keep up with
evolving organisational needs and threat landscapes. Emerging technologies,

Who Said Only Military Officers Can Deal with Uncertainty? On the Importance of Uncertainty in EdTech Data Visualisations,"Felicitas Macgilchrist, Juliane Jarke","AI-powered predictive systems have high margins of error. However, data

analyse data visualisations from predictive analytics platforms for education.
It demonstrates that visualisations of uncertainty in education are rare.
Second, the paper explores uncertainty visualisations in other fields (defence,
climate change and healthcare). The paper concludes by reflecting on the role

Zooming In on Fakes: A Novel Dataset for Localized AI-Generated Image Detection with Forgery Amplification Approach,"Lvpan Cai, Haowei Wang, Jiayi Ji, YanShu ZhouMen, Yiwei Ma, Xiaoshuai Sun, Liujuan Cao, Rongrong Ji","The rise of AI-generated image editing tools has made localized forgeries
increasingly realistic, posing challenges for visual content integrity.
Although recent efforts have explored localized AIGC detection, existing
datasets predominantly focus on object-level forgeries while overlooking
broader scene edits in regions such as sky or ground. To address these
limitations, we introduce \textbf{BR-Gen}, a large-scale dataset of 150,000
locally forged images with diverse scene-aware annotations, which are based on
semantic calibration to ensure high-quality samples. BR-Gen is constructed
through a fully automated Perception-Creation-Evaluation pipeline to ensure
semantic coherence and visual realism. In addition, we further propose
\textbf{NFA-ViT}, a Noise-guided Forgery Amplification Vision Transformer that
enhances the detection of localized forgeries by amplifying forgery-related
features across the entire image. NFA-ViT mines heterogeneous regions in
images, \emph{i.e.}, potential edited areas, by noise fingerprints.
Subsequently, attention mechanism is introduced to compel the interaction
between normal and abnormal features, thereby propagating the generalization
traces throughout the entire image, allowing subtle forgeries to influence a
broader context and improving overall detection robustness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BR-Gen constructs entirely new scenarios that are
not covered by existing methods. Take a step further, NFA-ViT outperforms
existing methods on BR-Gen and generalizes well across current benchmarks. All

Rethinking the Generation of High-Quality CoT Data from the Perspective of LLM-Adaptive Question Difficulty Grading,"Qianjin Yu, Keyu Wu, Zihan Chen, Chushu Zhang, Manlin Mei, Lingjun Huang, Fang Tan, Yongsheng Du, Kunlin Liu, Yurui Zhu","Recently, DeepSeek-R1 (671B) (DeepSeek-AIet al., 2025) has demonstrated its
excellent reasoning ability in complex tasks and has publiclyshared its
methodology. This provides potentially high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data
for stimulating the reasoning abilities of small-sized large language models
(LLMs). To generate high-quality CoT data for different LLMs, we seek an
efficient method for generating high-quality CoT data with LLM-Adaptive
questiondifficulty levels. First, we grade the difficulty of the questions
according to the reasoning ability of the LLMs themselves and construct a
LLM-Adaptive question database. Second, we sample the problem database based on
a distribution of difficulty levels of the questions and then use DeepSeek-R1
(671B) (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) to generate the corresponding high-quality
CoT data with correct answers. Thanks to the construction of CoT data with
LLM-Adaptive difficulty levels, we have significantly reduced the cost of data
generation and enhanced the efficiency of model supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
Finally, we have validated the effectiveness and generalizability of the
proposed method in the fields of complex mathematical competitions and code
generation tasks. Notably, with only 2k high-quality mathematical CoT data, our
ZMath-32B surpasses DeepSeek-Distill-32B in math reasoning task. Similarly,

A Bidirectional DeepParticle Method for Efficiently Solving Low-dimensional Transport Map Problems,"Tan Zhang, Zhongjian Wang, Jack Xin, Zhiwen Zhang","This paper aims to efficiently compute transport maps between probability
distributions arising from particle representation of bio-physical problems. We
develop a bidirectional DeepParticle (BDP) method to learn and generate
solutions under varying physical parameters. Solutions are approximated as
empirical measures of particles that adaptively align with the high-gradient
regions. The core idea of the BDP method is to learn both forward and reverse
mappings (between the uniform and a non-trivial target distribution) by
minimizing the discrete 2-Wasserstein distance (W2) and optimizing the
transition map therein by a minibatch technique. We present numerical results
demonstrating the effectiveness of the BDP method for learning and generating
solutions to Keller-Segel chemotaxis systems in the presence of laminar flows
and Kolmogorov flows with chaotic streamlines in three space dimensions. The
BDP outperforms two recent representative single-step flow matching and
diffusion models (rectified flow and shortcut diffusion models) in the
generative AI literature. However when the target distribution is
high-dimensional (4 and above), e.g. a mixture of two Gaussians, the
single-step diffusion models scale better in dimensions than BDP in terms of
W2-accuracy.",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11851v1,physics.comp-ph

Large Language Models for Drug Overdose Prediction from Longitudinal Medical Records,"Md Sultan Al Nahian, Chris Delcher, Daniel Harris, Peter Akpunonu, Ramakanth Kavuluru","The ability to predict drug overdose risk from a patient's medical records is

predicting drug overdose events using patients' longitudinal insurance claims
records. We evaluate its performance in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
comparing them to strong traditional machine learning methods as baselines. Our

Discrimination-free Insurance Pricing with Privatized Sensitive Attributes,"Tianhe Zhang, Suhan Liu, Peng Shi","Fairness has emerged as a critical consideration in the landscape of machine
learning algorithms, particularly as AI continues to transform decision-making
across societal domains. To ensure that these algorithms are free from bias and
do not discriminate against individuals based on sensitive attributes such as
gender and race, the field of algorithmic bias has introduced various fairness
concepts, along with methodologies to achieve these notions in different
contexts. Despite the rapid advancement, not all sectors have embraced these
fairness principles to the same extent. One specific sector that merits
attention in this regard is insurance. Within the realm of insurance pricing,
fairness is defined through a distinct and specialized framework. Consequently,
achieving fairness according to established notions does not automatically
ensure fair pricing in insurance. In particular, regulators are increasingly
emphasizing transparency in pricing algorithms and imposing constraints on
insurance companies on the collection and utilization of sensitive consumer
attributes. These factors present additional challenges in the implementation
of fairness in pricing algorithms. To address these complexities and comply
with regulatory demands, we propose an efficient method for constructing fair
models that are tailored to the insurance domain, using only privatized
sensitive attributes. Notably, our approach ensures statistical guarantees,
does not require direct access to sensitive attributes, and adapts to varying
transparency requirements, addressing regulatory demands while ensuring
fairness in insurance pricing.",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11775v1,stat.ML
Characterizing and Optimizing LLM Inference Workloads on CPU-GPU Coupled Architectures,"Prabhu Vellaisamy, Thomas Labonte, Sourav Chakraborty, Matt Turner, Samantika Sury, John Paul Shen","Large language model (LLM)-based inference workloads increasingly dominate
data center costs and resource utilization. Therefore, understanding the
inference workload characteristics on evolving CPU-GPU coupled architectures is
crucial for optimization. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of LLM
inference behavior on loosely-coupled (PCIe A100/H100) and closely-coupled
(GH200) systems. We analyze performance dynamics using fine-grained
operator-to-kernel trace analysis, facilitated by our novel profiler SKIP and
metrics like Total Kernel Launch and Queuing Time (TKLQT). Results show that
closely-coupled (CC) GH200 significantly outperforms loosely-coupled (LC)
systems at large batch sizes, achieving 1.9x-2.7x faster prefill latency for
Llama 3.2-1B. However, our analysis also reveals that GH200 remains CPU-bound
up to 4x larger batch sizes than LC systems. In this extended CPU-bound region,
we identify the performance characteristics of the Grace CPU as a key factor
contributing to higher inference latency at low batch sizes on GH200. We
demonstrate that TKLQT accurately identifies this CPU/GPU-bound transition
point. Based on this analysis, we further show that kernel fusion offers
significant potential to mitigate GH200's low-batch latency bottleneck by
reducing kernel launch overhead. This detailed kernel-level characterization

Safety with Agency: Human-Centered Safety Filter with Application to AI-Assisted Motorsports,"Donggeon David Oh, Justin Lidard, Haimin Hu, Himani Sinhmar, Elle Lazarski, Deepak Gopinath, Emily S. Sumner, Jonathan A. DeCastro, Guy Rosman, Naomi Ehrich Leonard, Jaime Fern√°ndez Fisac","We propose a human-centered safety filter (HCSF) for shared autonomy that
significantly enhances system safety without compromising human agency. Our
HCSF is built on a neural safety value function, which we first learn scalably
through black-box interactions and then use at deployment to enforce a novel
quality control barrier function (Q-CBF) safety constraint. Since this Q-CBF
safety filter does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics for both
synthesis and runtime safety monitoring and intervention, our method applies
readily to complex, black-box shared autonomy systems. Notably, our HCSF's
CBF-based interventions modify the human's actions minimally and smoothly,
avoiding the abrupt, last-moment corrections delivered by many conventional
safety filters. We validate our approach in a comprehensive in-person user
study using Assetto Corsa-a high-fidelity car racing simulator with black-box
dynamics-to assess robustness in ""driving on the edge"" scenarios. We compare
both trajectory data and drivers' perceptions of our HCSF assistance against
unassisted driving and a conventional safety filter. Experimental results show
that 1) compared to having no assistance, our HCSF improves both safety and
user satisfaction without compromising human agency or comfort, and 2) relative
to a conventional safety filter, our proposed HCSF boosts human agency,
comfort, and satisfaction while maintaining robustness.",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11717v1,cs.RO
Progent: Programmable Privilege Control for LLM Agents,"Tianneng Shi, Jingxuan He, Zhun Wang, Linyu Wu, Hongwei Li, Wenbo Guo, Dawn Song","LLM agents are an emerging form of AI systems where large language models
(LLMs) serve as the central component, utilizing a diverse set of tools to
complete user-assigned tasks. Despite their great potential, LLM agents pose
significant security risks. When interacting with the external world, they may
encounter malicious commands from attackers, leading to the execution of
dangerous actions. A promising way to address this is by enforcing the
principle of least privilege: allowing only essential actions for task
completion while blocking unnecessary ones. However, achieving this is
challenging, as it requires covering diverse agent scenarios while preserving
both security and utility.
  We introduce Progent, the first privilege control mechanism for LLM agents.
At its core is a domain-specific language for flexibly expressing privilege
control policies applied during agent execution. These policies provide
fine-grained constraints over tool calls, deciding when tool calls are
permissible and specifying fallbacks if they are not. This enables agent
developers and users to craft suitable policies for their specific use cases
and enforce them deterministically to guarantee security. Thanks to its modular
design, integrating Progent does not alter agent internals and requires only
minimal changes to agent implementation, enhancing its practicality and
potential for widespread adoption. To automate policy writing, we leverage LLMs
to generate policies based on user queries, which are then updated dynamically
for improved security and utility. Our extensive evaluation shows that it
enables strong security while preserving high utility across three distinct
scenarios or benchmarks: AgentDojo, ASB, and AgentPoison. Furthermore, we
perform an in-depth analysis, showcasing the effectiveness of its core
components and the resilience of its automated policy generation against
adaptive attacks.",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11703v1,cs.CR
A New Paradigm of User-Centric Wireless Communication Driven by Large Language Models,"Kuiyuan Ding, Caili Guo, Yang Yang, Wuxia Hu, Yonina C. Eldar","The next generation of wireless communications seeks to deeply integrate
artificial intelligence (AI) with user-centric communication networks, with the
goal of developing AI-native networks that more accurately address user
requirements. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) offers
significant potential in realizing these goals. However, existing efforts that
leverage LLMs for wireless communication often overlook the considerable gap
between human natural language and the intricacies of real-world communication
systems, thus failing to fully exploit the capabilities of LLMs. To address
this gap, we propose a novel LLM-driven paradigm for wireless communication
that innovatively incorporates the nature language to structured query language
(NL2SQL) tool. Specifically, in this paradigm, user personal requirements is
the primary focus. Upon receiving a user request, LLMs first analyze the user
intent in terms of relevant communication metrics and system parameters.
Subsequently, a structured query language (SQL) statement is generated to
retrieve the specific parameter values from a high-performance real-time
database. We further utilize LLMs to formulate and solve an optimization
problem based on the user request and the retrieved parameters. The solution to
this optimization problem then drives adjustments in the communication system
to fulfill the user's requirements. To validate the feasibility of the proposed
paradigm, we present a prototype system. In this prototype, we consider
user-request centric semantic communication (URC-SC) system in which a dynamic
semantic representation network at the physical layer adapts its encoding depth
to meet user requirements. Additionally, two LLMs are employed to analyze user
requests and generate SQL statements, respectively. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness.",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11696v1,cs.NI

of multimodal LLMs in forgery detection. We propose a framework capable of
evaluating image authenticity, localizing tampered regions, providing evidence,
and tracing generation methods based on semantic tampering clues. Our method
demonstrates that the potential of LLMs in forgery analysis can be effectively
unlocked through meticulous prompt engineering and the application of few-shot
learning techniques. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments and
show that GPT4V can achieve an accuracy of 92.1% in Autosplice and 86.3% in

Steering Prosocial AI Agents: Computational Basis of LLM's Decision Making in Social Simulation,Ji Ma,"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as human-like decision-making
agents in social science and applied settings. These LLM-agents are typically
assigned human-like characters and placed in real-life contexts. However, how
these characters and contexts shape an LLM's behavior remains underexplored.
This study proposes and tests methods for probing, quantifying, and modifying
an LLM's internal representations in a Dictator Game -- a classic behavioral
experiment on fairness and prosocial behavior. We extract ``vectors of variable
variations'' (e.g., ``male'' to ``female'') from the LLM's internal state.
Manipulating these vectors during the model's inference can substantially alter
how those variables relate to the model's decision-making. This approach offers
a principled way to study and regulate how social concepts can be encoded and
engineered within transformer-based models, with implications for alignment,
debiasing, and designing AI agents for social simulations in both academic and
commercial applications.",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11671v1,cs.AI
Towards Interpretable Deep Generative Models via Causal Representation Learning,"Gemma E. Moran, Bryon Aragam","Recent developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) rely on
machine learning techniques such as deep learning and generative modeling to
achieve state-of-the-art performance across wide-ranging domains. These
methods' surprising performance is due in part to their ability to learn
implicit ""representations'' of complex, multi-modal data. Unfortunately, deep
neural networks are notoriously black boxes that obscure these representations,
making them difficult to interpret or analyze. To resolve these difficulties,
one approach is to build new interpretable neural network models from the
ground up. This is the goal of the emerging field of causal representation
learning (CRL) that uses causality as a vector for building flexible,
interpretable, and transferable generative AI. CRL can be seen as a culmination
of three intrinsically statistical problems: (i) latent variable models such as
factor analysis; (ii) causal graphical models with latent variables; and (iii)
nonparametric statistics and deep learning. This paper reviews recent progress

MULTI-LF: A Unified Continuous Learning Framework for Real-Time DDoS Detection in Multi-Environment Networks,"Furqan Rustam, Islam Obaidat, Anca Delia Jurcut","Detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in Multi-Environment
(M-En) networks presents significant challenges due to diverse malicious
traffic patterns and the evolving nature of cyber threats. Existing AI-based
detection systems struggle to adapt to new attack strategies and lack real-time
attack detection capabilities with high accuracy and efficiency. This study
proposes an online, continuous learning methodology for DDoS detection in M-En
networks, enabling continuous model updates and real-time adaptation to
emerging threats, including zero-day attacks. First, we develop a unique M-En
network dataset by setting up a realistic, real-time simulation using the NS-3
tool, incorporating both victim and bot devices. DDoS attacks with varying
packet sizes are simulated using the DDoSim application across IoT and
traditional IP-based environments under M-En network criteria. Our approach
employs a multi-level framework (MULTI-LF) featuring two machine learning
models: a lightweight Model 1 (M1) trained on a selective, critical packet
dataset for fast and efficient initial detection, and a more complex, highly
accurate Model 2 (M2) trained on extensive data. When M1 exhibits low
confidence in its predictions, the decision is escalated to M2 for verification
and potential fine-tuning of M1 using insights from M2. If both models
demonstrate low confidence, the system flags the incident for human
intervention, facilitating model updates with human-verified categories to
enhance adaptability to unseen attack patterns. We validate the MULTI-LF
through real-world simulations, demonstrating superior classification accuracy
of 0.999 and low prediction latency of 0.866 seconds compared to established
baselines. Furthermore, we evaluate performance in terms of memory usage (3.632

large unsupervised datasets, via a contrastive learning formulation. It
produces a continuous feature field which can be clustered to yield a
hierarchical part decomposition. Comparisons show that PartField is up to 20%
more accurate and often orders of magnitude faster than other recent

eXplainable AI for data driven control: an inverse optimal control approach,"Federico Porcari, Donatello Materassi, Simone Formentin","Understanding the behavior of black-box data-driven controllers is a key
challenge in modern control design. In this work, we propose an eXplainable AI

explanations for the behavior of a controller operating around a given region.
Specifically, we extract the weights assigned to tracking errors and control
effort in the implicit cost function that a black-box controller is optimizing,
offering a more transparent and interpretable representation of the
controller's underlying objectives. This approach presents connections with
well-established XAI techniques, such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic
Explanations (LIME) since it is still based on a local approximation of the

Embodied World Models Emerge from Navigational Task in Open-Ended Environments,"Li Jin, Liu Jia","Understanding how artificial systems can develop spatial awareness and
reasoning has long been a challenge in AI research. Traditional models often
rely on passive observation, but embodied cognition theory suggests that deeper
understanding emerges from active interaction with the environment. This study
investigates whether neural networks can autonomously internalize spatial
concepts through interaction, focusing on planar navigation tasks. Using Gated
Recurrent Units (GRUs) combined with Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL), we
show that agents can learn to encode spatial properties like direction,
distance, and obstacle avoidance. We introduce Hybrid Dynamical Systems (HDS)
to model the agent-environment interaction as a closed dynamical system,
revealing stable limit cycles that correspond to optimal navigation strategies.
Ridge Representation allows us to map navigation paths into a fixed-dimensional
behavioral space, enabling comparison with neural states. Canonical Correlation
Analysis (CCA) confirms strong alignment between these representations,
suggesting that the agent's neural states actively encode spatial knowledge.
Intervention experiments further show that specific neural dimensions are
causally linked to navigation performance. This work provides an approach to
bridging the gap between action and perception in AI, offering new insights
into building adaptive, interpretable models that can generalize across complex
environments. The causal validation of neural representations also opens new
avenues for understanding and controlling the internal mechanisms of AI

Accelerating Multiscale Modeling with Hybrid Solvers: Coupling FEM and Neural Operators with Domain Decomposition,"Wei Wang, Maryam Hakimzadeh, Haihui Ruan, Somdatta Goswami","Numerical solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) face challenges
balancing computational cost and accuracy, especially in multiscale and dynamic
systems. Neural operators can significantly speed up simulations; however, they
often face challenges such as error accumulation and limited generalization in
multiphysics problems. This work introduces a novel hybrid framework that
integrates physics-informed DeepONet with FEM through domain decomposition. The
core innovation lies in adaptively coupling FEM and DeepONet subdomains via a
Schwarz alternating method. This methodology strategically allocates
computationally demanding regions to a pre-trained Deep Operator Network, while
the remaining computational domain is solved through FEM. To address dynamic
systems, we integrate the Newmark time-stepping scheme directly into the
DeepONet, significantly mitigating error accumulation in long-term simulations.
Furthermore, an adaptive subdomain evolution enables the ML-resolved region to
expand dynamically, capturing emerging fine-scale features without remeshing.
The framework's efficacy has been validated across a range of solid mechanics
problems, including static, quasi-static, and dynamic regimes, demonstrating
accelerated convergence rates (up to 20% improvement compared to FE-FE
approaches), while preserving solution fidelity with error < 1%. Our case
studies show that our proposed hybrid solver: (1) maintains solution continuity
across subdomain interfaces, (2) reduces computational costs by eliminating
fine mesh requirements, (3) mitigates error accumulation in time-dependent

Cancer-Myth: Evaluating AI Chatbot on Patient Questions with False Presuppositions,"Wang Bill Zhu, Tianqi Chen, Ching Ying Lin, Jade Law, Mazen Jizzini, Jorge J. Nieva, Ruishan Liu, Robin Jia","Cancer patients are increasingly turning to large language models (LLMs) as a
new form of internet search for medical information, making it critical to
assess how well these models handle complex, personalized questions. However,
current medical benchmarks focus on medical exams or consumer-searched

From Gaze to Insight: Bridging Human Visual Attention and Vision Language Model Explanation for Weakly-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation,"Jingkun Chen, Haoran Duan, Xiao Zhang, Boyan Gao, Tao Tan, Vicente Grau, Jungong Han","Medical image segmentation remains challenging due to the high cost of
pixel-level annotations for training. In the context of weak supervision,
clinician gaze data captures regions of diagnostic interest; however, its
sparsity limits its use for segmentation. In contrast, vision-language models
(VLMs) provide semantic context through textual descriptions but lack the
explanation precision required. Recognizing that neither source alone suffices,
we propose a teacher-student framework that integrates both gaze and language
supervision, leveraging their complementary strengths. Our key insight is that
gaze data indicates where clinicians focus during diagnosis, while VLMs explain
why those regions are significant. To implement this, the teacher model first
learns from gaze points enhanced by VLM-generated descriptions of lesion
morphology, establishing a foundation for guiding the student model. The
teacher then directs the student through three strategies: (1) Multi-scale
feature alignment to fuse visual cues with textual semantics; (2)
Confidence-weighted consistency constraints to focus on reliable predictions;
(3) Adaptive masking to limit error propagation in uncertain areas. Experiments
on the Kvasir-SEG, NCI-ISBI, and ISIC datasets show that our method achieves
Dice scores of 80.78%, 80.53%, and 84.22%, respectively-improving 3-5% over
gaze baselines without increasing the annotation burden. By preserving
correlations among predictions, gaze data, and lesion descriptions, our
framework also maintains clinical interpretability. This work illustrates how
integrating human visual attention with AI-generated semantic context can
effectively overcome the limitations of individual weak supervision signals,
thereby advancing the development of deployable, annotation-efficient medical

DeepWheel: Generating a 3D Synthetic Wheel Dataset for Design and Performance Evaluation,"Soyoung Yoo, Namwoo Kang","Data-driven design is emerging as a powerful strategy to accelerate
engineering innovation. However, its application to vehicle wheel design
remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets that
include 3D geometry and physical performance metrics. To address this gap, this
study proposes a synthetic design-performance dataset generation framework
using generative AI. The proposed framework first generates 2D rendered images
using Stable Diffusion, and then reconstructs the 3D geometry through 2.5D
depth estimation. Structural simulations are subsequently performed to extract
engineering performance data. To further expand the design and performance
space, topology optimization is applied, enabling the generation of a more
diverse set of wheel designs. The final dataset, named DeepWheel, consists of
over 6,000 photo-realistic images and 900 structurally analyzed 3D models. This
multi-modal dataset serves as a valuable resource for surrogate model training,
data-driven inverse design, and design space exploration. The proposed
methodology is also applicable to other complex design domains. The dataset is

Code Reborn AI-Driven Legacy Systems Modernization from COBOL to Java,Gopichand Bandarupalli,"This study investigates AI-driven modernization of legacy COBOL code into
Java, addressing a critical challenge in aging software systems. Leveraging the
Legacy COBOL 2024 Corpus -- 50,000 COBOL files from public and enterprise
sources -- Java parses the code, AI suggests upgrades, and React visualizes
gains. Achieving 93% accuracy, complexity drops 35% (from 18 to 11.7) and
coupling 33% (from 8 to 5.4), surpassing manual efforts (75%) and rule-based
tools (82%). The approach offers a scalable path to rejuvenate COBOL systems,
vital for industries like banking and insurance.",2025-04-15,2025-04-15,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11335v1,cs.SE

MA, to discuss the state of the database research field, its recent
accomplishments and ongoing challenges, and future directions for research and
community engagement. This gathering continues a long standing tradition in the
database community, dating back to the late 1980s, in which researchers meet
roughly every five years to produce a forward looking report.
  This report summarizes the key takeaways from our discussions. We begin with
a retrospective on the academic, open source, and commercial successes of the
community over the past five years. We then turn to future opportunities, with
a focus on core data systems, particularly in the context of cloud computing
and emerging hardware, as well as on the growing impact of data science, data
governance, and generative AI.
  This document is not intended as an exhaustive survey of all technical
challenges or industry innovations in the field. Rather, it reflects the
perspectives of senior community members on the most pressing challenges and
promising opportunities ahead.",2025-04-15,2025-04-15,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11259v1,cs.DB
3DAffordSplat: Efficient Affordance Reasoning with 3D Gaussians,"Zeming Wei, Junyi Lin, Yang Liu, Weixing Chen, Jingzhou Luo, Guanbin Li, Liang Lin","3D affordance reasoning is essential in associating human instructions with
the functional regions of 3D objects, facilitating precise, task-oriented
manipulations in embodied AI. However, current methods, which predominantly
depend on sparse 3D point clouds, exhibit limited generalizability and
robustness due to their sensitivity to coordinate variations and the inherent
sparsity of the data. By contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers
high-fidelity, real-time rendering with minimal computational overhead by
representing scenes as dense, continuous distributions. This positions 3DGS as
a highly effective approach for capturing fine-grained affordance details and
improving recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, its full potential remains
largely untapped due to the absence of large-scale, 3DGS-specific affordance
datasets. To overcome these limitations, we present 3DAffordSplat, the first
large-scale, multi-modal dataset tailored for 3DGS-based affordance reasoning.
This dataset includes 23,677 Gaussian instances, 8,354 point cloud instances,
and 6,631 manually annotated affordance labels, encompassing 21 object
categories and 18 affordance types. Building upon this dataset, we introduce
AffordSplatNet, a novel model specifically designed for affordance reasoning
using 3DGS representations. AffordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal
structure alignment module that exploits structural consistency priors to align
3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, resulting in enhanced affordance
recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat
dataset significantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGS domain,
while AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms existing methods across both seen
and unseen settings, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities.",2025-04-15,2025-04-16,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11218v2,cs.CV
